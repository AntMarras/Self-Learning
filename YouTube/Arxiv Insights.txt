5. Variational Autoencoders

Image Segmentation, Image Denoising(force encoder to get rid of noise), Image Inpainting
VAE has input mapped to a distribution, MEAN & STD of distribution.
We have re-parametrization trick, where we pick z = mu + sigma.eps, where eps is sampled
Dis-entangled autoencoders, different neuron in distribution be uncorrelated.
